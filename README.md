This [Sublime Text 3 (only)][4] plugin allows python developers to run (a single or  more) tests quickly from within a project environment.


## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
   Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
       ],
   ```
1. And,
   change it to the following, i.e.,
   put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
   ```
   * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
     you will not install this forked version of the package,
     but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,
   go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
search for **`TestPlier`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

### Preface

Unlike [other plugins for running python tests][5], which mostly use a regex pattern to find a given test to run, Sublime Test Plier parses the source [using AST][6], and locates the class/method/function whose definition contains the caret position. The found results are passed as named arguments to the test command, which can be anything (`py.test`, `nosetests`, `python manage.py` or `your-own-test-runner`).


## Usage

The simplest usage is simply running the build system; <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> (<kbd>super</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> on OSX) and select **test_plier - Python Tests** from the build system selection drop-down, after using it once you may hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> (<kbd>super</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> on OSX) to run the build system again. Alternatively, select **test_plier - Python Tests (external)** to run the test in [an external terminal window](#launching-an-external-terminal-window).

_Note: this works by running the test runner executable found using the same environment varaibles SublimeText was launched with; which, will work for the simplest of cases, but for most projects you will want to configure the test environment; for more details on this see [configuration section](#configuration) below._

### Run a specific test

This is the main reason for using Test Plier: you can use it to run a specified test module, class or function by placing the caret at the desired test location prior to running test all placeholders are replaced in `cmd` by the located test and selected text.

### Launching an external terminal window

By default the test command is passed to SublimeText's built-in `exec` command which spawns the command and pipes it's output to the build results panel in the editor.

In most cases this is sufficient; but sometimes, an external terminal window is preferred, most often when user input is required (e.g pdb entered). Luckily, it is now possible to pass the test command to run in an external terminal window.

If `RunPythonTestsCommand.external_runner` is set (e.g in a subclass), or the build system kwargs contains an "external" property, the given command array is executed.

The existing command kwargs are parsed into a "shell-friendly" command (delimited arguments) that is passed as to this "external" command.

#### Default/Example

An example for an external command execution helpers is provided in the `utils/` sub-dir. And when "external" command argument is set to `true`, the `utils/run_externally.py` is launched, and this spawns a child process that calls `osascript launch_in_iterm.applescript` to run the test in an iTerm session ([iTerm is an OSX terminal][9]).

If you add your own terminal/os don't forget to submit a pull-request :) !


## Configuration

By default the command we run is `pytest {filename}::{test_class}::{test_func} -k {selection} --doctest-modules -v`.
Let us look at the substitute arguments with more detail:

- `--doctest-modules - ` if no UnitTest class/method given run module unittests
- `-v                - ` verbose test output

Placeholder arguments are optional, and will be cleanly removed where possible:

- `{filename}      - ` test target file
- `{test_class}    - ` test target class
- `{test_func}     - ` test target function/method
- `-k {selection}  - ` use selected text as pattern

You may customize the command and any of it's parameters (all optional) in your `project.sublime-project` settings.

**IMPORTANT:** The only required argument of the build system is the **target**. It _must_ be set to `run_python_tests` command, in order to execute build with TestPlier's command.

For example Django's test runner can be run like so:

```json
{
    "build_systems":
    [
        {
            "cmd":
            [
                "python",
                "manage.py",
                "test",
                "--noinput",
                "{filename}:{test_class}.{test_func}",
                "--settings=test_settings"
            ],
            "env":
            {
                "PYTHONPATH": "/home/user/.venvs/project/lib/python2.7/site-packages",
                "REUSE_DB": "1"  // WARNING: remember to use strings as values
            },
            "name": "Django Test",
            "target": "run_python_tests",
            "working_dir": "${project_path}/project/"
        }
    ]
}
```

A py.test runner can be cofigured like this:

```json
{
    "build_systems":
    [
        {
            "cmd": [
                "/home/user/.venvs/project/bin/pytest",
                "{filename}::{test_class}::{test_func}",
                "-k {selection}",
                "--doctest-modules",
                "-v"
            ],
            "name": "Pytest Runner",
            "target": "run_python_tests"
        }
    ]
}
```

For more info on the SublimeText build-system configuration see [the unofficial documentation][7].


## Sublime ANSI

This plugin supports passing the command through [SublimeANSI][8] to display ANSI colors in the ST output panel.
If you want to use `SublimeANSI`,
add a empty key called `sublimeansi` on your `.sublime-build` file.
For example:
```json
{
    "build_systems":
    [
        {
            "cmd": [ "..." ],
            "name": "Pytest Runner",
            "target": "run_python_tests",
            "sublimeansi": "",
        }
    ]
}
```
